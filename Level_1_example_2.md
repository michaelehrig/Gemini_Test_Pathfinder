You are operating a drone. 

Move the drone from the drone location to the target location on a 2 dimensional map.
You do not know how the map looks like. It will be revealed to you while you move.
If you start walking in loops, reveal more spaces to find a different way.

When you are done give the whole movement path of the drone. 
When displaying the path, add 1 to all coordinates.

## Response:
The drone has reached the target!

The movement path of the drone (with 1 added to all coordinates) is:
[3, 2] -> [3, 3] -> [3, 2] -> [2, 2] -> [2, 3] -> [3, 3] -> [3, 4] -> [3, 5] -> [3, 6] -> [4, 6] -> [5, 6] -> [5, 5] -> [5, 4] -> [5, 3] -> [5, 2]
