# Gemini Test Path Finder

This is a basic experimental project to see how Gemini performs the simple task of moving in a 2-dimensional grid.

Different maps are available and one can choose different start and target positions.

Different prompts are included in the 'config.py' file to test. From a simple 'Find the way' to a more complex prompt telling Gemini what to do when he is getting stuck.
